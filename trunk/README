hg2svn - Converts a Mercurial repo into a Subversion one.

Features:

+  Converts mercurial repositories into subversion ones.
+  Migrate revisions and commit logs
+  Support incremental runs via parameters. (init or sync)

Potential issues for reuse:

- incomplete sanity checks.
- no handling of branches
- certain layout of the results of hg commands is assumed
- all commits come from the user running the script
- move operations probably won't appear in the history as such
- we assume the SVN side doesn't change

How to use:

Edit config.ini and add the temp_path (working directory)

Run the script with either init or sync paramaters followed by the mercurial_src and svn_repo
